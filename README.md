## Advice: use hard-coded values as "scaffolding"

- copy/paste example data from the documentation or from Postman
- use the example data as part of your JSX in App.js
- move the new JSX to its own file (it will break!)
- fix it by adding props

### Then add event listeners


## Approach #1 - show one character

- look at the API
- copy/paste the character info as a var
- then create component to show that data
